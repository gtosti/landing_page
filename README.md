# Landing Page

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, specifically the **"Landing Page"** exercise. The goal was to recreate a static web page from a provided design using HTMLL and CSS, with an emphasis on Flexbox.

## What I learned

- Semantic HTML
- Advanced Flexbox usage
- Styling based on a visual design
- Code organization and CSS best practice (I hope hehe)"
